# JoinMarket dust threshold for CoinJoin operations
# Set to 10x BITCOIN_DUST_THRESHOLD to provide safety margin for:
# 1. Fee estimation uncertainties in collaborative transactions
# 2. Ensuring outputs remain economically spendable
# 3. Avoiding rejection by peers due to changing network conditions
#
# This is a JoinMarket policy, not a Bitcoin protocol rule.
# Reference: JoinMarket sets this to 27300 sats (0.000273 BTC)
DUST_THRESHOLD = 10 * BITCOIN_DUST_THRESHOLD  # 27300 satoshis

# Default dust threshold for non-CoinJoin operations
# Can use the lower BITCOIN_DUST_THRESHOLD for direct payments
# This allows flexibility while maintaining safety for CoinJoin outputs
DEFAULT_DUST_THRESHOLD = DUST_THRESHOLD  # 27300 satoshis (conservative default)
